The Bites app is a platform designed to connect users with local pastry and cake shops. It allows users to browse and purchase pastries and cakes online, and have them delivered to their location.  

The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly search for and purchase items. Users can browse a wide variety of pastries and cakes, view images and descriptions, and select items for purchase.  

When a user selects an item, the app checks to see if it is available and can be delivered to the user's location. If the item is available, the user can add it to their cart and proceed to checkout. The app uses a payment gateway to securely process transactions, and provides users with a confirmation of their order.  

Once the order is confirmed, the app sends a notification to the pastry or cake shop to begin preparing the order. The shop then delivers the order to the user's location, using the Bites app to track the delivery and ensure that the order is delivered in a timely and efficient manner.  

Overall, the Bites app is designed to provide users with a convenient and reliable way to purchase and receive pastries and cakes. It is user-friendly, secure, and efficient, making it easy for users to find and purchase items, and for pastry and cake shops to manage and fulfill orders  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
